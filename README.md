# Voice-command-tool-windows
A simple tool for setting voice commands to any file on your windows pc
simply copy and paste the code into whatever environment you want and run 
enter text for the vocal input youd like to assign then pick a file from your computer to assign it to, there are no restrictions on filetypes so be wary
i plan to add more to the tool in the future , ease of use items such as a drop down application list and system commands(such as volume/brightness/window controls). 
thanks for looking let me know if its something I should continue working on ....
Change your hotkey to any entry youd like , I set the deault to "9"to start listning.  always listening felt invasive but later releases may have a toggle option. on close it will move to system tray but still be waiting for hotkey press
